              Founded in 2012, Kappa Theta Pi serves as the only co-ed professional technology fraternity in the nation. As one of the fastest growing chapters with brothers from all majors, we pride ourselves in the individuality of each brother which strengthens our collective identity. Our five core values: Professional Development, Alumni Connections, Social Growth, Technological Advancement, and Academic Support, guide how we operate and support each other from within the chapter and beyond.

              I’ve had the privilege of being in Kappa Theta Pi for a majority of my college career and it has been, without a doubt, one of the best decisions I’ve made since stepping foot on campus. From the unforgettable experiences to the incredible people, this fraternity has given me more than I could have ever imagined. For that, I am deeply grateful.
